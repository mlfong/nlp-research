Code and scripts for undergraduate research cs-4699, independent study in natural language processing.
	An analysis of hot topics in social networks by looking at Twitter [global] trends.

Nomenclature is based on GT's last three weeks of school. 
Hell [week] - 2 weeks before finals
Dead [week] - 1 week before finals
Finals

Dependencies:
	Twitter4j
	Bing Search Java SDK (which I believe is defunct now :( )
	UMass' Mallet
	Weka
	NLTK

Running scripts are echo, echo2, echo_final
	-> calls compile
	-> calls run every 10 minutes
parserhell.py creates the .arff file, and does the NLP stuff inside (using NLTK, bing api, etc)
